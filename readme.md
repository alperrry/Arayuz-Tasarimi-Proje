#Explain Project
-The website we have created aims to enable people to choose their accommodation for holidays in advance by providing information about hotels. Users can access information, photos of the hotel, rooms, and services, along with reviews, to ensure they have a satisfying holiday experience without regrets.

#Preparation period
-Research: We researched and experienced websites with similar content.
-Planning: We defined the project scope and discussed how we would approach it.
-Design: We discussed how each element would be positioned and created drafts accordingly.
-Development: Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, we created the final version of   the website based on the drafted design.
-Testing: We conducted comprehensive tests to ensure the website functions correctly across different browsers and devices. This included testing for usability and accessibility.
   


#Design Process: We created a website suitable for the idea we decided on. We aimed for a simple yet functional design that users can easily understand and create reservations with.
